df=pd.read_csv('heart(2).csv')


# This code loads a CSV file named "heart(2).csv" into a Pandas DataFrame called df. The pd.read_csv() function reads the file and converts its contents into a structured table, allowing for easy data manipulation and analysis. This is commonly used for loading datasets in data science and machine learning projects.

# In[4]:


df.shape


# The df.shape command returns the dimensions of the DataFrame df as a tuple (rows, columns). The first value represents the number of rows (data entries), and the second represents the number of columns (features). This helps quickly understand the dataset's size and structure.

# In[5]:


df.size


# The df.size attribute returns the total number of elements (cells) in the DataFrame. It is calculated as the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns. Unlike df.shape, which provides separate row and column counts, df.size gives a single integer representing the total data points in the DataFrame.

# In[6]:


df.info()


# This output provides a summary of the DataFrame, showing that it has 918 rows and 12 columns. Each column's name, data type (int64, float64, or object), and the number of non-null values are displayed. The dataset includes numerical features like Age, RestingBP, Cholesterol, and MaxHR, as well as categorical features like Sex, ChestPainType, and RestingECG. The target variable, HeartDisease, is likely a binary classification label. The memory usage of the DataFrame is approximately 86.2 KB.

# In[7]:


df.describe()


# This statistical summary provides key insights into the dataset's numerical features. It includes count, mean, standard deviation (std), minimum (min), maximum (max), and quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) for each column. The average age is 53.51 years, with a range of 28 to 77 years. RestingBP (blood pressure) has a minimum value of 0, which may indicate missing or incorrect data. Cholesterol levels vary widely, from 0 to 603, suggesting possible missing values or extreme outliers. The FastingBS (fasting blood sugar) column is mostly 0, meaning only a small percentage of patients have elevated blood sugar levels. MaxHR (maximum heart rate) ranges from 60 to 202, and Oldpeak (ST depression) has a wide range, from -2.6 to 6.2, indicating variability in patientsâ€™ heart conditions. The target variable, HeartDisease, is binary, with about 55.3% of patients having heart disease (mean = 0.553).

# In[8]:


df.columns


# This output shows the column names (or feature names) of the DataFrame as an Index object. The dataset includes numerical features like Age, RestingBP, Cholesterol, MaxHR, and Oldpeak, as well as categorical features like Sex, ChestPainType, RestingECG, ExerciseAngina, and ST_Slope. The target variable HeartDisease indicates whether a patient has heart disease. These features are essential for analysis and building predictive models.

# In[9]:


df.isnull().sum()


# This output shows the count of missing values for each column in the dataset. Since all columns have a value of 0, it indicates that there are no missing values in the dataset. This means the data is complete and does not require imputation or handling of missing entries before analysis or model training.

# In[10]:


df.duplicated().sum()


# np.int64(0) creates a NumPy 64-bit integer with the value 0. It is a specific data type (int64), commonly used in numerical computations for high precision and efficient memory usage. This is useful in data processing, ensuring compatibility with NumPy arrays and operations.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA)

plt.show()


# The Class Distribution output shows that the dataset contains 508 cases (1) of heart disease and 410 cases (0) without heart disease, indicating a slightly imbalanced dataset. The FutureWarning message appears because in Seaborn v0.14.0, using palette without specifying hue will no longer be supported. To fix this, the hue parameter should be set to x, and legend=False should be added to maintain the intended visualization.

df[numerical_features].hist(figsize=(12, 10), bins=20)
plt.suptitle("Univariate Analysis: Histograms", fontsize=14)
plt.show()


# This image displays univariate histograms for key numerical features in the dataset, helping to visualize their distributions. The Age, RestingBP, Cholesterol, and MaxHR histograms show approximately normal distributions, with most values concentrated around the mean. The FastingBS histogram is highly skewed, indicating that most patients have low fasting blood sugar, with a few having high values. The Oldpeak histogram is also skewed, suggesting that most patients have lower ST depression values. These visualizations help in understanding data distribution, detecting outliers, and deciding on potential preprocessing steps.This bar chart represents the distribution of the HeartDisease variable, which is binary (0 = No, 1 = Yes). The dataset has slightly more patients with heart disease (around 508) than those without (around 410), indicating a mild class imbalance. This distribution is important for model training, as imbalance can affect classification performance.

# BIVARIATE ANALYSIS

# Pair plot for numerical variables
sns.pairplot(df[numerical_cols], diag_kind="kde", plot_kws={'alpha':0.5, 's':10})
plt.show()


# This bar chart shows the distribution of the HeartDisease variable, where 0 represents no heart disease and 1 represents the presence of heart disease. The dataset is slightly imbalanced, with more patients diagnosed with heart disease (508 cases) than those without (410 cases). This imbalance can impact predictive modeling, as machine learning models might become biased toward the majority class. Proper techniques such as resampling, class weighting, or using balanced evaluation metrics (e.g., F1-score) can help improve model performance and ensure fair predictions. Understanding class distribution is crucial for developing an effective heart disease prediction system.

# CORRELATION MATRIX

# Add title
plt.title("Correlation Heatmap of Features")

# Show plot
plt.show()


# This correlation heatmap illustrates the relationships between various features in the dataset, with values ranging from -1 to 1 to indicate the strength and direction of correlations. The target variable, HeartDisease, has a negative correlation with MaxHR (-0.40), meaning that a lower maximum heart rate is associated with a higher likelihood of heart disease. Conversely, Oldpeak (0.40) has a strong positive correlation with HeartDisease, suggesting that higher ST depression levels are linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Other features like Age (0.28) and FastingBS (0.27) show mild positive correlations, implying that older individuals and those with high fasting blood sugar are more prone to heart disease. Cholesterol (-0.23) has a weak negative correlation, indicating a limited direct impact on heart disease risk.

### Feature Importance Analysis ###
X = df.drop(columns=['HeartDisease'])
y = df['HeartDisease'] # Changed 'target' to 'heart_disease'


# In this feature importance analysis, the dataset is divided into input features (X) and the target variable (y), where X contains all columns except 'HeartDisease', and y represents the 'HeartDisease' column. This step is essential for training machine learning models, as it separates the independent variables (predictors) from the dependent variable (outcome), allowing the model to learn patterns that influence heart disease prediction.

# Import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Encode categorical variables if any
label_encoders = {}
for column in df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns:
    le = LabelEncoder()
    df[column] = le.fit_transform(df[column])
    label_encoders[column] = le
# ... (rest of your code)


# This code uses Label Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values, making them suitable for machine learning models. It first identifies columns with categorical data (dtype='object'), then applies LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing to transform them into numerical representations. The fitted encoders are stored in the label_encoders dictionary for potential inverse transformations later. This step is crucial for handling non-numeric data in machine learning pipelines.

# In[18]:


# Encode categorical variables if any
label_encoders = {}
for column in df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns:
    le = LabelEncoder()
    df[column] = le.fit_transform(df[column])
    label_encoders[column] = le

# Separate features and target (assuming the last column is the target)
X = df.iloc[:, :-1]
y = df.iloc[:, -1]

# Perform feature selection using ANOVA F-test

feature_scores_df = feature_scores_df.sort_values(by='Score', ascending=False)
print("Feature Scores:\n", feature_scores_df)

# Print selected features
print("Selected Features:", selected_features.tolist())


# The feature importance scores indicate the most influential factors in predicting heart disease. ST_Slope, ExerciseAngina, and Oldpeak are the top three most important features, suggesting that stress test results and exercise-induced symptoms play a significant role. MaxHR and ChestPainType also contribute substantially, highlighting the importance of heart rate and chest pain characteristics. Sex and Age have moderate influence, while FastingBS, Cholesterol, and RestingBP show lower importance. RestingECG has the least impact on prediction. The selected features include all variables, meaning they all provide some predictive value, with varying degrees of influence.

plt.show()


# The bar chart displays feature importance scores from a Random Forest model for heart disease prediction. ST_Slope is the most influential feature, followed by ChestPainType and Oldpeak, suggesting that ECG changes, chest pain characteristics, and ST depression levels significantly impact the prediction. Cholesterol, MaxHR, and ExerciseAngina also contribute notably. Age, RestingBP, and Sex have moderate importance, while RestingECG and FastingBS have the least impact. These results help in understanding which factors play the most crucial roles in detecting heart disease.

print(f"Training Set: {X_train.shape}, Test Set: {X_test.shape}")


# The dataset is split into a training set of 734 samples and a test set of 184 samples, each with 5 features. This split ensures that the model learns patterns from the training data and is then evaluated on unseen test data to assess its performance. A typical 80-20 or 70-30 split strategy is used in machine learning to balance learning and evaluation, helping to prevent overfitting while ensuring the model generalizes well to new data.

print("Class Distribution Before Balancing:", Counter(y_train))


# The dataset is imbalanced, with 406 instances of class 1 (Heart Disease present) and 328 instances of class 0 (No Heart Disease). This imbalance can affect model performance, leading to biased predictions favoring the majority class. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using balanced class weights can help address this issue.

print("Class Distribution Before Balancing:", Counter(y_train))
print("Class Distribution After Balancing:", Counter(y_train_resampled))


# The code applies Random Under-Sampling to balance the dataset before training a model for heart disease prediction. First, it splits the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets while ensuring stratification, meaning both sets maintain the original class distribution. Since the dataset is imbalanced, RandomUnderSampler is used to reduce the majority class instances in the training set, making both classes equal in size. This prevents the model from being biased toward the majority class and improves prediction performance, especially for the minority class.The training set initially had more instances of class 1 (406 cases) than class 0 (328 cases), indicating an imbalance. After applying Random Under-Sampling, the majority class (1) was reduced to 328 cases, making both classes equal and improving model fairness.

# In[23]:


from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler

under = RandomUnderSampler(sampling_strategy='auto', random_state=42)
X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced = under.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)


# The RandomUnderSampler reduces the majority class samples to match the minority class, balancing the dataset. Here, sampling_strategy='auto' ensures both classes have equal instances after resampling. This helps prevent model bias toward the majority class and improves fair classification.

# The dataset originally had 918 samples, but after removing outliers, it was reduced to 278 samples, indicating that a significant number of data points were considered outliers. Outliers are extreme values that can negatively impact model performance, and their removal helps in improving model accuracy and generalization. The cleaned dataset still retains important features such as Age, Sex, ChestPainType, RestingBP, Cholesterol, MaxHR, and HeartDisease, ensuring it remains useful for heart disease prediction. However, the drastic reduction in data size may lead to information loss, which should be carefully analyzed before proceeding with model training.

# The array represents a binary classification output, likely indicating predictions for heart disease, where 1 represents the presence of heart disease and 0 represents its absence. The distribution of 1s and 0s appears fairly balanced, suggesting that the dataset used for prediction was either naturally balanced or processed to ensure equal representation. This result could be an output from a machine learning model, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or a neural network, trained to predict heart disease based on selected features. The effectiveness of these predictions should be further evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine how well the model differentiates between patients with and without heart disease.

# The model predicts the likelihood of heart disease with 79% accuracy, meaning it correctly classifies 79% of cases. Out of 102 individuals at risk (actual heart disease cases), 79 were correctly predicted (True Positives), but 23 were missed (False Negatives), meaning they were wrongly classified as not at risk. For the 82 individuals not at risk, 66 were correctly predicted (True Negatives), while 16 were incorrectly classified as at risk (False Positives). The precision for predicting heart disease is 83%, meaning when the model predicts a person is at risk, it is correct 83% of the time. However, the recall for heart disease is 77%, indicating that 23% of actual at-risk individuals were not identified, which could lead to missed preventive measures. To improve prediction reliability, reducing false negatives should be a priority.

# The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 78%, meaning it correctly predicted heart disease risk for 78 out of every 100 individuals. This suggests that the model is fairly effective but still makes errors in 22% of cases, which could lead to misclassified individualsâ€”either falsely predicting heart disease risk (false positives) or missing actual at-risk cases (false negatives). While Random Forest is a robust model due to its ensemble learning approach, further improvements, such as tuning hyperparameters, adding more relevant features, or addressing class imbalances, could help enhance its predictive performance and reduce misclassification rates.
